Yggdrasil
=========

Yggdrasil is a concept for an augmented reality game, intially to be set at [Burning Man](http://burningman.com). It is very much a work in progress, but some of the current concepts are:

* Twelve factions where a player can have multiple pseudo-identities within each
* Players control which of their network intersections are available to others
* Points are bitcoin
* At the end of a round, the points are pooled, divided into 13 parts, and everyone gets one with an additional for the leader
* [Black Rock City](http://alexlod.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/brc.jpeg) is overlaid with [a map designating differential authority](http://dhappy.github.io/yggdrasil/)
* Modeling of the activities and participants to [optimize for satisfaction](http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2014/04/rationale-for-the-department-of-happiness/)

## Teams

The teams are named after aspects of Norse cosmology:

* ᛗ ― Miðgarðr: Humans
* ᚫ ― Ásgarðr: Heroes
* ᚡ ― Vanaheimr: Sages
* ᚦ ― Jötunheimr: Giants
* ᛃ ― Álfheimr: Elves
* ᛏ ― Hel: Corpses
* ᛠ ― Svartálfaheimr: Dwarves
* ᛁ ― Niflheimr: Ice
* ᛊ ― Múspellsheimr: Fire
* <img src='http://dhappy.org/.../image/animal/dragon/pair/svg' style='height:20px'/> ― Níðhöggr: Dragon who gnaws at Yggdrasil
* <img src='http://dhappy.org/.../image/animal/squirrel/svg' style='height:20px'/> ― Ratatoskr: Squirrel who lives in Yggdrasil
* <img src='http://dhappy.org/.../image/animal/phoenix/svg' style='height:20px'/> ― Veðrfölnir: Hawk sitting on an eagle perched on Yggdrasil

## Captains

Teams dynamics is still very conceptual. Each team having a Captain would produce potentially useful singly-rooted trees. I'd like at least half the Captains chosen by [electronic ballot](//github.com/TheFuturistParty/vote).

1. [Will](//twitter.com/WHolcomb) ― Ratatoskr
2. ¿[Kesha](//twitter.com/KeshaRose)?
3. ¿[Elon](//twitter.com/ElonMusk)?
4.  

## Subgames

* Infiltration
* Wagers
