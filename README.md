Yggdrasil
=========

Yggdrasil (pronounced "Yidd-ra-sil") is a concept for an augmented reality game, intially to be set at [Burning Man](http://burningman.com). It is very much a work in progress, but some of the current concepts are:

* Three teams with a genetic default membership:
  * Red: X*
  * Blue: XY
  * Purple: Anything else
* [Thirteen factions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fnYEKILyb9uAjrIDOoHZm_36Kkn3AvyphXReDg-Fbk8/edit?usp=sharing) where a player can have multiple pseudo-identities within each
* A rotating "house" corresonding to the solar calendar
* Players control which of their aliases and contacts are accessible to others
* [Black Rock City](http://alexlod.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/brc.jpeg) is overlaid with [a map designating differential authority](http://dhappy.github.io/yggdrasil/)
* Modeling of the activities and participants to [optimize for satisfaction](http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2014/04/rationale-for-the-department-of-happiness/)

## Teams

The teams are named after aspects of Norse cosmology:

* ᛗ ― Miðgarðr: Humans
* ᚫ ― Ásgarðr: Heroes
* ᚡ ― Vanaheimr: Sages
* ᚦ ― Jötunheimr: Giants
* ᛃ ― Álfheimr: Elves
* ᛏ ― Hel: Corpses
* ᛠ ― Svartálfaheimr: Dwarves
* ᛁ ― Niflheimr: Ice
* ᛊ ― Múspellsheimr: Fire
* 🐲 ― Níðhöggr: Dragon who gnaws at Yggdrasil
* 🐿️ ― Ratatoskr: Squirrel who lives in Yggdrasil
* 🦅 ― Veðrfölnir: Hawk sitting on an eagle perched on Yggdrasil
* 🌳 ― Yggdrasil: The tree itself

## Months

Months are demarked by the constelations opposite the sun in the plane of the elliptic according to the 13 sign zodiac:

* ♑ ― Capricorn: 1/21–2/16
* ♒ ― Aquarius: 2/16–3/11
* ♓ ― Pisces: 3/11–4/18
* ♈ ― Aries: 4/18–5/13
* ♉ ― Taurus: 5/13–6/21
* ♊ ― Gemini: 6/21–7/20
* ♋ ― Cancer: 7/20–8/10
* ♌ ― Leo: 8/10–9/16
* ♍ ― Virgo: 9/16–10/30
* ♎ ― Libra: 10/30–11/23
* ♏ ― Scorpio: 11/23–11/29
* ⛎ ― Ophiuchus: 11/29–12/27
* ♐ ― Sagittarius: 10/30–11/23

## Events

The game is centrally a process for interconnecting a series of events grounded on the cusps between months and transitions of decision-making power.

## Subgames

* Infiltration
* Wagers
* Bargaining

## Synthesis

The thirteen teams are broken into two groups of five and a set of three under the "generalships" of red, blue, and purple.

Those organizations have a genetic base membership of red: X\*, blue: XY, & purple: U - (X\* + XY)
