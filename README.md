Yggdrasil
=========

Yggdrasil is a concept for an augmented reality game, intially to be set at [Burning Man](http://burningman.com). It is very much a work in progress, but some of the current concepts are:

* Twelve factions where a player can have multiple pseudo-identities within each
* Players control which of their aliases and contacts are accessible to others
* Points are bitcoin
* At the end of a round, the points are pooled, divided into 13 parts, and everyone gets one with an additional for the leader
* [Black Rock City](http://alexlod.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/brc.jpeg) is overlaid with [a map designating differential authority](http://dhappy.github.io/yggdrasil/)
* Modeling of the activities and participants to [optimize for satisfaction](http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2014/04/rationale-for-the-department-of-happiness/)
