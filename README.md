Yggdrasil
=========

Yggdrasil (pronounced "Yadd-ra-sil") is a concept for an augmented reality game. It is very much a work in progress, but some of the current concepts are:

## Runes

The teams are named after aspects of Norse cosmology:

* ᛗ ― Miðgarðr: Humans
* ᚫ ― Ásgarðr: Heroes
* ᚡ ― Vanaheimr: Sages
* ᚦ ― Jötunheimr: Giants
* ᛃ ― Álfheimr: Elves
* ᛏ ― Hel: Corpses
* ᛠ ― Svartálfaheimr: Dwarves
* ᛁ ― Niflheimr: Ice
* ᛊ ― Múspellsheimr: Fire
* 🐲 ― Níðhöggr: Dragon who gnaws at Yggdrasil
* 🐿️ ― Ratatoskr: Squirrel who lives in Yggdrasil
* 🦅 ― Veðrfölnir: Hawk sitting on an eagle perched on Yggdrasil
* 🌳 ― Yggdrasil (pronounced "Ig-drah-səl"): The tree itself

## Teams

Ten teams plus three alliances make up the thirteen players.

The alliances are:
* Red (🦅): ᛃ, & 
* Blue (🐲): ᛏ, ᚦ & 
* Purple (🐿️): 🌳, & 

## Months

Months are demarked by the constelations opposite the sun in the plane of the elliptic according to the 13 sign zodiac. Note that the lengths are [wildly different](https://gist.run/embed.html?id=e29f776b9a9b0c3d52251a28c573977c).

* ♐ ― Sagittarius: 10/30–11/23
* ♑ ― Capricorn: 1/21–2/16
* ♒ ― Aquarius: 2/16–3/11
* ♓ ― Pisces: 3/11–4/18
* ♈ ― Aries: 4/18–5/13
* ♉ ― Taurus: 5/13–6/21
* ♊ ― Gemini: 6/21–7/20
* ♋ ― Cancer: 7/20–8/10
* ♌ ― Leo: 8/10–9/16
* ♍ ― Virgo: 9/16–10/30
* ♎ ― Libra: 10/30–11/23
* ♏ ― Scorpio: 11/23–11/29
* ⛎ ― Ophiuchus: 11/29–12/27

## Cusps

Events occur in the cusps between months. Each month, beginning with -1/♉/38, a combination of two players holds an event where teams are able to meet as part of an agile sprint.

* ♐ ― 
* ♑ ― 
* ♒ ―

* ♈ ― 
* ♉ ― 🐿️
* ♊ ― 
* ♋ ―

The set of colors is: Red, Blue, Purple, Violet, Green, Orange, Silver, Gold, Copper, Black, White, Pink, Yellow

* ᛗ ― 
* ᚫ ― 
* ᚡ ―

## Land

A major goal is to establish a new dynamic of soverignties. Currently states cannot opt out of federal intervention. I want to create [jurisdictions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XvAvezvRjSKvptEHPf5xprtMqiwGnfBk&usp=sharing) where federal laws do not apply for certain issues. Also arresting authority wuold be limited. 


## Events

* 2021/01/20 = 0/♑/0 — Innaguration of a candidate using a variety of assistive technologies to transform the office.

## Issues

The office has 10 primary foci that it is attempting to address:

* Housing
* Transparent Supply Chain

## Money

There are two huge allocations of cash that I want to get at. The defense budget and the 1%.

## War

War is a complex issue with a variety of causes. To address it broadly, I want to record lots of videos of the higher ups.

## The 1%

The rankings for allowing month allocation are based on GDP + median wage * # of employees.

## Software

## Identities

All teams have some system of identification. Each is different:

* You buy ids
* Existing members have k ids per month to give out
* Only "admins" can distribute ids
* Ids are randomly generated
* Ids are verified via voter registration address
* Ids are first-come-first-serve in a flat namespace


## Subgames

* Infiltration
* Wagers
* Bargaining
