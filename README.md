Yggdrasil
=========

Yggdrasil (pronounced "Yadd-ra-sil") is a concept for an augmented reality game. It is very much a work in progress, but some of the current concepts are:

## Teams

Ten teams plus three alliances make up the thirteen players.

The alliances are:
* Red: ᛃ, , 
* Blue: ᛏ, ᚦ, ,
* Purple: 🐿️, 🌳, ,

## Runes

The teams are named after aspects of Norse cosmology:

* ᛗ ― Miðgarðr: Humans
* ᚫ ― Ásgarðr: Heroes
* ᚡ ― Vanaheimr: Sages
* ᚦ ― Jötunheimr: Giants
* ᛃ ― Álfheimr: Elves
* ᛏ ― Hel: Corpses
* ᛠ ― Svartálfaheimr: Dwarves
* ᛁ ― Niflheimr: Ice
* ᛊ ― Múspellsheimr: Fire
* 🐲 ― Níðhöggr: Dragon who gnaws at Yggdrasil
* 🐿️ ― Ratatoskr: Squirrel who lives in Yggdrasil
* 🦅 ― Veðrfölnir: Hawk sitting on an eagle perched on Yggdrasil
* 🌳 ― Yggdrasil (pronounced "Ig-drah-səl"): The tree itself

## Months

Months are demarked by the constelations opposite the sun in the plane of the elliptic according to the 13 sign zodiac. Note that the lengths are [wildly different](https://gist.run/embed.html?id=e29f776b9a9b0c3d52251a28c573977c).
